        The Frenchman Vincent Fabron lives his life in search of one necessary goal, willing to sacrifice anything that gets in his way of achieving it.
        He has spent much of his time involved with combat and weapons, having worked for the French military before becoming a PMC marksman and then a weapons designer for 
        <a href="https://valorant.fandom.com/wiki/Kingdom_Corporation">Kingdom</a>
        Defense. 
        His employment at Kingdom was only a stepping stone for him though, 
        as by this point he was already set on his path in pursuit of his sacred truth.

            employees and the facility was reduced to a husk. Not long after the events of Everett-Linde,
            Fabron encountered senior VALORANT Protocol agents
            <a href="https://valorant.fandom.com/wiki/Brimstone">Brimstone</a>
            and
            <a href="https://valorant.fandom.com/wiki/Viper">Viper</a>
            , where together they were put in an unpleasant situation.
            After promoting himself as someone who could help VALORANT out with their Omega Project, the Protocol's leadership gave Fabron a position as their eighteenth agent. Becoming "Chamber",
            he immediately proved himself to be a necessary asset to the VP's goals, providing blueprints necessary to properly construct an Alpha-Omega teleporter, as well as helping with its
            power issues by recommending a prospective agent with radiant abilities that could help.
